  <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Lindsay Jenkins, and I created Speak with Strength to help students and young professionals conquer their fear of public speaking.</p>
    <p>As someone who once struggled to speak up in meetings or interviews, I know how overwhelming it can feel to find your voice. This platform is a safe space to practice, grow, and build the confidence you need to succeed, whether you're preparing for a presentation, a job interview, or just want to express yourself clearly.</p>
    <p>Why I started Speak with Strength: I wanted to give people especially my son the tools I wish I had when I was starting out. We offer support,feedback,and a community that understands what it means to feel nervous but still show up and try anyway.</p>
    <p>Together, weâ€™ll work through the nerves, strengthen your skills, and celebrate your progress every step of the way.</p>
    <p>My son faced the same challenges as he entered college and struggled with public speaking and interviews.</p>
